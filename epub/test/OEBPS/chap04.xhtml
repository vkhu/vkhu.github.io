<p>
  <strong>Put the user at the core of your project!
or how not to let technical constraints drive your mind ?</strong>
</p>

<p>Sometimes, I am called upon to review new (commercially released) interface designs here &amp; there. I’m viewed by some companies as “the guy who is never happy” with their interfaces, again, because they so often seem to miss the point.</p>

<p>Indeed, as a frequent beta tester, I have some systematic reactions when I’m testing a new interface. When I’m doing that, I’m just a user; certainly a hard to please user, but a user all the same.</p>

<p>I would like to show you some interfaces I discovered (again) in the music controller world.
Those examples are commercially available controllers!</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-monotonous-monochromatic-leds">Monotonous Monochromatic LEDs</h3>

<p>This is a phenomenon I discovered, which is difficult to illustrate, but very famous and very weird problem. This refers to all the indicator lights being the same colors. Just put me to sleep while I work with your interface. :-P</p>

<p>On behalf of all of us users, I asked “WHY?” and,
you know, I had more than enough answers to my question, but very annoying and inexcusable answers, at least from the end-user perspective.
I guess they’re perfect answers if you design but never have to use.
I’m sure you’ll recognize them.</p>

<div class="image-with-caption center">
  <img src="images/03.PNG" alt="The &quot;Incomprehensible Mis-Alignment&quot; problem" /><p class="caption">The “Incomprehensible Mis-Alignment” problem</p>
</div>

<p>A perfect column of buttons, with a single knob at the top, and “just a little bit” off-center.</p>

<p>About The “incomprehensible mis-alignment“ problem, I had:</p>

<p>– “ Oh man, you can easily use the first knob for the first column of buttons” ; no comment</p>

<p>– “Those knobs aren’t only for using them linked with the column” ; indeed. But we, users, are using them like that, so…</p>

<p>The real problem was about printed circuit boards which had been badly designed, considering the space in the box!</p>

<p>It was a purely technical manufacturing problem,
a design mistake that drove to making a misaligned interface design.</p>

<p>Another result, less important, is the aesthetic: it looks ugly like that. But it isn’t the most important, I agree, compared to the ergonomy! Ergonomy has to be considered firstly, because it facilitates the user work.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-where-is-that-track-">Where Is That Track ?</h3>

<div class="image-with-caption center">
  <img src="images/04.PNG" alt="The &quot;where is that track&quot; problem" /><p class="caption">The “where is that track” problem</p>
</div>

<p>About The “where is that track” problem, I had:</p>

<p>– “oh man, noone uses this interface like you !!” ; they said I wasn’t a common user.</p>

<p>– “if we had put knobs above, the interface would
be too big” ; at least, it is honest to talk about their technical constraint :)</p>

<p>Every user I spoke with told me they use the interface… like me (which is very nice for me to figure out, because I understood I wasn’t so weird after all ); each column represents a track (often in Ableton Live… again this one !). So… you have to count from left to right… 1…2…3, ok this is the track 3, then . . . (or is it from the bottom up ?) It fails! The first thing I would do if I had bought this interface: use it after a 90° rotation Clockwise. Ergonomy has to consider users, at least those under the bell gaussian curve.</p>

<p>About The “monotonous monochromatic leds” problem, I had nothing else than:
– driving rgb leds is more difficult and it involves more power, more code in the firmware</p>

<p>This time, I’ll give you my answer to their one: work smarter and find the solution!</p>

<p>Indeed, users need to have more than 2 states leds. Ok, we can have 3 states with monochromatic leds: on/off blinking. But we, users, need more on stage. Because we want to focus on the result: the art we’re trying to create &amp; perform. 2+blink states aren’t enough. End of story.</p>

<p>Ergonomy has to give the greatest flexibility to users. So, considering the two previous problems, even if they have technical constraint, they should think about that: they have these big constraints because they work for humans in order to facilitate their life and in order to remove their constraints.</p>

<p>This is their job : to relieve constraints and resolve to make the users’ job to use products without constraint! It involves a change in thinking : working a bit smarter, designing for simpler user process.</p>

<p>. . . and less living in a state of denia !</p>

<p>With some companies, I also discussed working on interface design like a multimedia controller.
Here’s a tip, (and this could be the main tip) : be the user ! Use it, or lose it !</p>

<p>Project managers often forget, at each step of their project, to sit in the user’s chair.
It is usual because they are saturated by other tasks, considering cost challenge, time &amp; schedule, pure technical considerations etc.</p>

<p>But the best one sits each day in the user’s chair. If you sit in the user’s chair, you’ll design better interfaces !</p>
