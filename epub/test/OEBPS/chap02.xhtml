<p>
  <strong>A user interface involves a User, a System, the Interface itself and some protocols arranged a bit like this</strong>
</p>

<ul><li>The <strong>User</strong> is you (or folks you target for your interface design).</li>
  <li>The <strong>System</strong> is the tool you need to use in the most ergonomic manner possible.</li>
  <li>A <strong>protocol</strong> is a standardized set of rules previously decided for making different entities communicating.</li>
</ul><p>You want to be able to control the system and get some sort of feedback from it. The interface facilitates usage of the system, because it is the translator between the system and you.</p>

<p>This concept is very important. An interface can translate many things into many other things. Basically, you have to understand that an interface sends messages but must convert them from one <strong>protocol</strong> into another protocol so that it’s understood at the other end. As an example, the interface can convert (one of the possible translations) a linear movement of a finger into a logarithmic numeric variation of a parameter. (Translation : use a volume slider). It could also translate it into an analog voltage which has a value.</p>

<p>As another example, an interface can understand
and convert messages from/to a world talking MIDI protocol into/from a world talking OSC protocol (OSC and MIDI both being protocols used in the worlds
of music &amp; multimedia) to make music machines communicate amongst themselves.)</p>

<p>We’ll also talk about other concepts, but we’ll describe them step-by-step and not in too much in detail, in order to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Now we can move further and dive inside my protocol for developing these interface devices.</p>
