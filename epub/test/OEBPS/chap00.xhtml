<h2 id="leanpub-auto-about">About</h2>

<p>You can find my bio <a href="http://julienbayle.net/bio/">here</a>
I’m a french digital artist and art teacher. I’m also an Ableton Certified Trainer and Max6 programmer.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/Max-for-Live-Ultimate-Zen-Guide">Max for Live Ultimate Zen Guide</a> and published it in 2013.</p>

<p>But, I wrote this one in 2010.
Schematics have been designed from my drafts by Manuela Ciancilla and the book itself have been proofread by Glenn Reuther.
This short guide had been originally published in 2010. </p>

<p>I especially let it exactly as it was for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul><li>it was my first ebook and I wanted to keep the first version of it</li>
  <li>I wanted to see how much I could have changed since this very first ebook</li>
</ul>
