  <strong>User Interface Design is the art of building the elusive missing link between you and the system you want to control and then hear the desired results.</strong>
</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in user interface design is to keep the user perspective as the focal point of any <strong>Interface Design project</strong>.</p>

<p>As a case in point, just take a look at the grand majority of popular user interfaces, and how they are commonly used.</p>

<p>Once you do, you’ll begin to understand that a lot
of companies (even the biggest ones) seem to have forgotten this main idea.</p>

<p>They inevitably cut corners to keep costs low, while sacrificing this crucial element; they fail to see the forest for trees. Many owners of these devices have
to create work-arounds in their processes just to accomplish half of what they hoped the device
would do, after they shelled out their hard-earned cash for it. This goes for software even more. Even then, they often fall woefully short of expectations.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that this process is so often overlooked when engineering these device designs. It’s like forgetting to include the design for a toilet in a spaceship; kind of important. Don’t you think ? Kind of embarrassing too. :-P</p>

<p>I have always been interested in interfaces; from cell membranes in biology, to writing software applications and hardware drivers.</p>

<p>Ultimately, in the performing arts, which requires specialized tool to control complex creative systems, each piece on which I work is an interface to control some system.</p>

<p>For me, the best user interface is one whose design provides a rich and complete tool which enables the user to easily accomplish their tasks; one in which the interface itself becomes invisible, when its user is able to concentrate solely on the process.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it becomes a distraction. In this way, the user is directly connected to the system, because the interface has become an extension of the performer. Performer and system are then one.</p>

<p>Speaking on the level of the most basic equation, on one side is a human being. On the other side is any other thing in his/her world, but in between each is the interface (as well as a medium through which it is understood and used) which provides the connection. It’s a critical component, but the one that is most taken for granted. What would it be like if any of the following were missing from your equation:</p>

<p>a common language, network, postal services, signage, cars, and even more elementally, air, water, gravity… Also, an interface can serve as a translator between two things which don’t communicate in the same way.</p>

<p>From your mobile phone to your car, from the pull-down menus in a software application or even
the application itself, or from the DJ console to this matrix of buttons or pads so many make music with, everything is interfaced. Humans travel in a world filled with interfaces to all systems he/she has to interact with. Considering this point, imagine all user interfaces were correctly made, were all useful and even efficient.</p>

<p>Again, if we look closely enough at those already existing, we see this isn’t the case.
Even big companies with large R&amp;D budgets, and a fully qualified staff of engineers, who may have all studied user interface design at school; bad user interface design is still widespread.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-does-bad-mean-">What does bad mean ?</h3>
<p>Bad equals any or all of the following :</p>

<ul><li>ugly</li>
  <li>inefficient</li>
  <li>unintuitive</li>
  <li>too general</li>
  <li>too precise</li>
  <li>inconsistent</li>
  <li>too small</li>
  <li>or even too cryptic</li>
</ul><p>Understand that building a good and usable interface is a complex task, requiring considerable thought. Knowing this you have to come to the realization that even if it is complex, <strong>it can be done</strong>. If large corporations can’t do it, <strong>you can do it</strong>.</p>

<p>And you’re lucky: I offer you the opportunity to break the vicious cycle driving the designs of those bad interfaces. You can really make the difference by building your best user interface ever !</p>

<p>In the next few pages, you’ll discover the principles and methods which I follow when designing and building large and complex hardware interfaces such as <strong><a href="http://julienbayle.net/works/creation/protodeck-midi-controller-for-ableton-live/">Protodeck</a></strong> ; you’ll come closer to visualizing the hardware controller of your dreams, and all its interfaces with the final application you wish to control and get feedback from, as I have.</p>

<p>I designed and built the Protodeck controller, as well as the BONOME controller (the more widely known of the two), for use both on stage, and in the studio.</p>

<p>They are both hardware interfaces designed to have remote-control of the Digital Audio Workstation called Ableton Live.
As I was going through the various stages of their development of these devices, I documented the journey on <a href="http://julienbayle.net/blog/">my blog</a> .</p>

<p>I have since been invited to do presentations in several European cities, and most recently New York City,
to showcase my story, the how’s and why’s I felt it important to realize these designs, and to share my knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>I often use examples in the field of music controllers because it is very easy to illustrate.</p>
